# Comparision-of-TCN-and-IRNN
For most profound deep learning specialists, sequence modelling is synonymous with recurrent systems. However late outcomes show that convolutional structures can beat recurrent networks on assignments, for example, audio synthesis and machine interpretation. Given another sequence modelling task or dataset, which architectural design would it be a good idea for one to utilize is answered by the experiments. Leading a precise assessment of convolutional and recurrent networks over an expansive scope of standard errands that are usually used to benchmark recurrent networks. Our outcomes show that a basic Convolutional Engineering beats Independent Recurrent system. 
We infer that the regular affiliation between sequence modelling and recurrent systems ought to be re-examined, and convolutional systems ought to be viewed as a whiz beginning stage for arrangement demonstrating sequencing modelling task

In order to address the questions like whether the convolutional sequence modelling works on different application domains with precision or the Independent Recurrent Networks outperforms or both challenges typical recurrent networks like LSTM and GRU the Empirical Evaluation is must. The series of different experiments are conducted and achieved amazing set of outcomes. The tasks are designed in such a way that it serves as test bench for both the models.

The evaluation mainly focused on comparing convolutional and Independent Recurrent networks on sequence modelling tasks.
The TCN model represents the convolutional networks family and on other hand Independent Recurrent Networks represents recurrent architectural patterns.

The results indicate that reconsidering TCN for sequential tasks and memory retention tasks is important. The TCN model outperforms IRNN in the memory related tasks like adding problem. TCN is simple and inexpensive and clear and producing accurate results. On the other hand, IRNN performs better than canonical recurrent architectures but it is complex to implement and expensive to experiment. TCN is having slightly upper hand on the interpretation of the sequential models than IRNN. 

Three different experiments are carried on both architectures considering their pros and cons, reconciling TCN for sequential modelling tasks are the conclusion drawn from the experiments.
